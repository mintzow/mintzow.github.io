California gun owners applauded the Supreme Court&apos;s decision, which reaffirmed that state officials cannot require concealed carry applicants to demonstrate &quot;proper cause&quot; and &quot;a special need for self-defense distinguishable from that of the general community.&quot;</p><p>&quot;On Monday, the California Department of Justice&apos;s 2022 Firearms Dashboard Portal went live, with publicly accessible files containing identifying information for those with concealed carry permits.&quot; The leaked information includes the person&apos;s full name, race, home address, date of birth, and permit issuance date. The information also includes the type of permit issued, as well as whether the permit holder is a member of law enforcement or a judge.&quot;</p><p>According to The Reload, they reviewed a copy of the Lost Angeles County database and discovered 244 judge permits listed in the database, including all of their home addresses, full names, and dates of birth. &quot;The same was true for seven detention officers, 63 people with a work permit, and 420 reserve officers.&quot;</p><p>Gov.
